# Micro Computer Server Cases
3D printed server rack node cases is made for mounting Raspberry Pi, SSD, external hard drives, and more.

## Terminology
- Server rack node case: is the case you can mount on a 19" server rack, comprised of 3 cases to simplify printing.
- Side case: the case that has the mounting holes for the 19" server rack.
- Middle case: the case that connect the left and right side.
- Node: e.g., Raspberry Pi, SSD, external hard drives, etc.
- Node holder: what a node is mounted to fit in a case.
- Case inter height: the inside vertical dimension of the case. This is the maximum allowed width of a node.
- Case inter width: the inside horizontal dimension of the case.
- Case outer height: is the same as 1U, 2U, etc.
- Case outer width: is not the total width of a case instead it's using a standardized side thickness.
- Node hole vertical distance: is the distance between the bottom node mounting hole to the top mounting hole.
- Node hole horizontal distance: is the distance between the one node mounting hole to the next.
